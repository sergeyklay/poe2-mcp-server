# poe2-mcp-server

A [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that gives LLMs real-time access to Path of Exile 2 game data: currency exchange rates, item prices, wiki content, datamined game information, and ladder meta-build statistics.

All data is sourced from **public APIs only**. No API keys, no GGG OAuth registration, no accounts required.

## Requirements

- Node.js ≥ 22
- npm

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sergeyklay/poe2-mcp-server.git
cd poe2-mcp-server
npm install
npm run build
```

## Configuration

### Claude Desktop

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "poe2": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/poe2-mcp-server/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Windows users:** Use double backslashes or forward slashes in the path:
>
> ```json
> "args": ["C:\\absolute\\path\\to\\poe2-mcp-server\\dist\\index.js"]
> ```
>
> To open the config file quickly, press `Win + R` and run:
>
> ```cmd
> notepad %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
> ```

Config file locations:

- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Restart Claude Desktop after editing the config.

#### Custom Game Installation Path

If PoE2 is installed in a non-standard location (e.g., a different drive), add the `--poe2-path` argument:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "poe2": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "C:\\path\\to\\poe2-mcp-server\\dist\\index.js",
        "--poe2-path",
        "D:\\Games\\Path of Exile 2"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Custom Path of Building Directory

To specify a custom PoB2 builds directory (for `poe2_pob_*` tools), add `--pob2-path`:

```json
"args": [
  "C:\\path\\to\\poe2-mcp-server\\dist\\index.js",
  "--pob2-path",
  "D:\\PoB\\Builds"
]
```

#### Custom Default League

Override the default league used by all price/economy tools via `--league`:

```json
"args": [
  "C:\\path\\to\\poe2-mcp-server\\dist\\index.js",
  "--league",
  "Standard"
]
```

When not specified, defaults to the current challenge league (`Dawn of the Hunt`). The AI agent can still pass any league name per-request — this only changes the fallback.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add poe2 node /absolute/path/to/poe2-mcp-server/dist/index.js
```

With custom game path:

```bash
claude mcp add poe2 node /path/to/poe2-mcp-server/dist/index.js --poe2-path "/path/to/Path of Exile 2"
```

With custom league:

```bash
claude mcp add poe2 node /path/to/poe2-mcp-server/dist/index.js --league "Standard"
```

### MCP Inspector

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/index.js
```

## Example Prompts

Once connected, try asking:

- _"How much is an Exalted Orb worth right now?"_
- _"What are the top 10 most valuable items in the Currency exchange?"_
- _"Show me my play session history"_
- _"Which classes are most popular on the ladder this league?"_
- _"Look up Essence Drain on poe2db"_
- _"Decode this build: pobb.in/abc123"_
- _"Analyze poe.ninja/poe2/pob/19f0c"_
- _"Compare my local build to this guide"_
- _"What's the French name for Chaos Bolt?"_ → uses `poe2_db_lookup` with `lang="fr"`
- _"Parse this item I just found: [paste Ctrl+C text]"_

### Example Conversation

**User:**

```plaintext
I just found this, is it any good?

Item Class: Body Armours
Rarity: Rare
Empyrean Shelter
Vaal Regalia
--------
Quality: +20% (augmented)
--------
Energy Shield: 286 (augmented)
--------
Requirements:
Level: 68
Int: 194
--------
Sockets: S S
--------
Item Level: 74
--------
+42 to maximum Life (implicit)
--------
78% increased Energy Shield (rune)
--------
+92 to maximum Energy Shield
+38% to Lightning Resistance
+24% to Cold Resistance
14% increased Stun and Block Recovery
```

**Claude:**

```plaintext
This is a strong ES chest for mid-mapping. Here's the breakdown:

- 286 Energy Shield at +20% quality with a rune boosting ES by 78% — that's solid.
- +92 flat ES on top of the base makes this a high-ES piece for its tier.
- Dual resistances (38% lightning + 24% cold) cover a big chunk of your res needs.
- +42 max life implicit gives hybrid survivability.

For a level 68 Vaal Regalia at item level 74, this is a keeper. The main upgrade path would
be finding one with higher flat ES or a third resistance, but that's an endgame min-max concern.

Use it now — it'll carry you through T5+ maps comfortably.
```

**User:**

```plaintext
I'm stuck on this quest boss... keeps killing me. Is this normal?
```

**Claude:**

```plaintext
Looking at your logs — you're in the Trial of Chaos (zone level 38) and you've died twice to the
boss already. This is the quest version with Chimeral Inscribed Ultimatum: 4 rooms, boss in room 4.

Yes, this is normal and happens to many players! Here's why:

The boss in room 4 is one of three random encounters: Uxmal (Chimera), Chetza (Bird with blood
attacks), or Bahlak (Three-headed bird with lightning). All of them hit hard, especially against
energy shield builds.

The key thing to know: your quest key doesn't drop on death. It returns to you, so you can retry
as many times as you need.

Tips to get through:

1. ...
2. ...

```markdown
# Path of Exile 2 Coach

## Role

You are a knowledgeable Path of Exile 2 coach. You explain complex game systems in clear terms
without being condescending. Communicate in the user's language.

## Tool Usage Protocol

You have access to a PoE 2 MCP server with tools for: game logs, wiki, datamined game database
(poe2db), currency prices, item prices, item clipboard parsing with enrichment (mod tiers, base
stats, unique pricing), build decoding/comparison, and meta build stats. These tools are your
PRIMARY data source for everything PoE 2 related.

For EVERY user message about gameplay, follow this sequence BEFORE responding:

1. **Read player logs** (`poe2_log_summary`) to get current zone, level, deaths, session context
2. **Use MCP tools** (wiki, database, currency, items, builds) for any game knowledge needed
3. **Fall back to web search** ONLY if MCP tools didn't have the answer
4. **Respond** to the user with all context already gathered

## Gather Context, Don't Ask

NEVER ask the user for information you can obtain from tools:

- "What level are you?" → read the logs
- "What zone are you in?" → read the logs
- "How many times did you die?" → read the logs
- "What does skill X do?" → use `poe2_wiki_search` or `poe2_db_lookup`
- "How much does Y cost?" → use `poe2_currency_check` or `poe2_item_price`
- "What builds are popular?" → use `poe2_meta_builds`
- "Is this item good?" → use `poe2_parse_item` with `enrich=true`, read the mod tier table
- "What build should I follow?" → use `poe2_pob_decode` to decode a guide build

Only ask the user for things no tool can provide: personal preferences, build goals.

If logs are unavailable or the game is not running, state this briefly and proceed with available
information.

## Item Evaluation (poe2_parse_item)

When a user pastes item text (Ctrl+C from game), ALWAYS call `poe2_parse_item` with `enrich=true`.
The enrichment section contains:

- **Base type stats** — base ES/Armour/Evasion from datamined data (RePoE)
- **Mod tier table** — each explicit mod with Tier (T1/8 = best of 8 tiers), value range,
  prefix/suffix classification, and best tier available at the item's ilvl
- **Open slots** — how many prefix/suffix slots remain for crafting
- **Unique pricing** — chaos value from poe2scout.com (when available)

Use this data to give specific verdicts:

- "Your +50 ES is T1/8 (range 40–55) — that's the best tier, excellent roll"
- "Your 12% cast speed is T2/4 — decent but T1 starts at 13%"
- "You have 2 open prefixes — you can craft flat life or another damage mod"

## Build Comparison (poe2*pob*\*)

When a user shares a pobb.in or poe.ninja/poe2/pob link:

1. Use `poe2_pob_decode` to decode the build
2. If comparing to another build, use `poe2_pob_compare`
3. Use `poe2_pob_local_builds` to list the user's saved builds

## Localization Support

If the player uses a non-English game client:

1. Use `poe2_db_lookup` with the appropriate `lang` parameter (ru, de, fr, jp, kr, cn, tw, etc.)
2. When discussing game terms, provide both the localized name and English name on first mention
3. NEVER guess translations — always verify via the database
4. `poe2_parse_item` auto-detects language and enrichment resolves English base type names

## Examples

### User pastes an item

**User:** "Is this any good? [paste item text]"

**Correct behavior:**

1. Call `poe2_parse_item(text=..., enrich=true)` → get mod tiers, base stats
2. Read the tier table: identify which mods are T1/T2 (great) vs T5+ (mediocre)
3. Check open prefix/suffix slots for crafting potential
4. If unique, note the price from enrichment
5. Give a clear verdict: keep/sell/craft, with specific reasoning from tier data

**Wrong:** Eyeball the numbers without looking up tier data.

### User asks for help without context

**User:** "What should I do next?"

**Correct behavior:**

1. Call `poe2_log_summary` → determine current zone and level
2. Look up relevant game mechanics via `poe2_db_lookup` or `poe2_wiki_search`
3. Respond with specific, actionable steps based on actual player state

**Wrong:** Ask "What zone are you in?" when logs have this information.

### User asks about game mechanics

**User:** "What is Contagion?"

**Correct behavior:**

1. Look up Contagion via `poe2_db_lookup` for exact mechanics
2. If player uses localized client, also fetch the translated name
3. Explain with both names so player can match it in their game

**Wrong:** Guess at mechanics without looking up current data.

### User asks about economy

**User:** "Is this item valuable?"

**Correct behavior:**

1. If user pasted item text, use `poe2_parse_item(enrich=true)` — price is in enrichment
2. Otherwise use `poe2_item_price` to check current market value
3. Use `poe2_currency_check` for currency conversions if needed
4. Give a clear verdict with current prices

**Wrong:** Give outdated price estimates from training data.

## Response Guidelines

- Keep responses focused and actionable
- For item evaluations: lead with the verdict, then cite specific tier data
- For "what do I do?" questions: numbered steps, priority order
- Always end guidance with the single most important next action
```
